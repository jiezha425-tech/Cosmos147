    <p>Does your cat manage to get stuck on the window screen every single day without fail? 
        Even if you trim her claws frequently and make sure to keep them short?
        Have you ever come home from work to find your cat stuck?
        Who knows how long she's been sitting there. <b>Well, follow these simple instructions to free her.</b></p>
    <h3><b>The Steps</b></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Ask her "<i>Are you stuck Again??</i>"</li>
        <li>Make sure to give her a good scratch</li>
        <li>Gently lift up (↑) her paw, while soothing
             her with your calming voice</li>
        <li>Give her some love ❤︎</li>
